#Query vs Mutation
- Query are executed Simultaneously
- Mutation are executed sequentially

- it's recommended for every mutation's response to include the data that the mutation modified. This enables clients to obtain the latest persisted data without needing to send a followup query.

#Schema
Types:
- Scaler types
  {
    Int,
    Float,
    String,
    Boolean,
    ID
  }
- custom Types
  {
    const typeDefs = gql`
      scalar Date

      type MyType {
        created: Date
      }
    `
  }
- Object types
  {
    type Book {
      author: Author,
      title: String
    }
  }
- Query types
  {
    type Query {
      books: [Book]
    }
  }
- Mutation types
  {
    type Mutation {
      addBook(title: String, author: String): Book
    }

    mutation CreateBook {
      addBook(title: "Fox in stocks", author: "Dr Seuss") {
        title
        author {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
- Input types
{
  type Mutation {
    createPost(input: PostAndMediaInput): Post
  }
  input PostAndMediaInput {
    title: String,
    mediaUrls: [String]
  }
}
- Enum types
{
  enum AllowedColor {
    RED
    GREEN
    BLUE
  }

  type Query {
    favoriteColor: AllowedColor
  }
}

# Query-driven schema design
- Design your schema based on how data is used, not based on how it's stored.
- If your data store includes a field or relationship that your clients don't need yet, omit it from your schema. 
It's easier and safer to add a new field to a schema than it is to remove an existing field that some of your clients are using.

# mutation response interface
single mutation can modify multiple types, or multiple instances of the same type. For example, a mutation that enables a user to "like" a 
blog post might increment the likes count for a Post and update the likedPosts list for the User. This makes it less obvious what the structure 
of the mutation's response should look like.

Additionally, mutations are much more likely than queries to cause errors, because they modify data

To help resolve both of these concerns, we recommend defining a MutationResponse interface in your schema

```
interface MutationResponse {
  code: String!
  success: Boolean!
  message: String!
}

type UpdateUserEmailMutationResponse implements MutationResponse {
  code: String!
  success: Boolean!
  message: String!
  user: User!
}

{
  data: {
    updateUser: {
      code: 200
      success: true,
      message: User email was successfully update
      user {
        id: 1
        name: "Behrooz Tabesh"
        email: "Behrooz@gmail.com
      }
    }
  }
}

```

# schema Directive

@deprecated(reason: String) - marks field as deprecated with message
@skip(if: Boolean!) - GraphQL execution skips the field if true by not calling the resolver
@include(if: Boolean!) - Calls resolver for annotated field if true


# Resolver data:
- Resolver is defined in file call resolver map

(parent, args, context, info)
- parent: The return value of the resolver for this field's parent.
- args: argument is an object that contains all GraphQL arguments that were provided for the field by the GraphQL operation.
- context: An object shared across all resolvers that are executing for a particular operation. Use this to share per-operation state, including:
authentication information, 
dataloader instances, 
and anything else to track across resolvers.
context is and object will set only once, but if it is function will be called every time there is a call to any API

- Authorization & DB startup
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  tracing: true,
  context: ({req}) => ({
    authScope: getScope(req.headers.authorization)
  })
  OR 
  context: ({req}) => ({
    db: await client.connect()
  })
})

(parent, args, context, info) => {
  if(context.authScope !== ADMIN) throw AuthenticationError('not admin')
}

(parent, args, context, info) => {
  return context.db.query('SELECT * FROM table')
}

# Resolver Chain

- schema
type Library {
  branch: String!
  books: [Book!]
}

type Book {
  title: String!
  author: Author!
}

type Author {
  name: String!
}

type Query {
  libraries: [Library]
}

- Client Query
query {
  libraries {
    books {
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

- resolver chain
Query.libraries --> Library.books() ---> Book.author() --> Author.name()


- resolvers

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    libraries() {
      return libraries
    },
    Library: {
      books(parent) {
        return books.filter(book => book.branch === parent.branch)
      }
    },
    Book: {
      author(parent) {
        name: parent.author
      }
    }
  }
}

# Data Sources
Data sources are classes that encapsulate fetching data from a particular service, with built-in support for:
- caching,
- deduplication,
- error handling

# Data Loader
deduplicating and batching object loads from a data store. It provides a memoization cache, which avoids loading the same 
object multiple times during a single GraphQL request, and it coalesces loads that occur during a single tick of the event 
loop into a batched request that fetches multiple objects at once.


const { RESTDataSource } = require('apollo-datasource-rest)

class MovieAPI extends RESTDataSource {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.baseURL = 'url'
  }

  // Intercept all request
  - store user token
  - add query parameter
  willSendRequest(request) {
    request.header.set('Authorization', this.context.token)
    request.params.set('api_key', this.context.token)
  }

  async getMovie(id) {
    return this.get(`movies/${id}`)
  }

  async getMostViewedMovies(limit=10) {
    const data = await this.get('movies', {
      limit: limit,
      orderBy: 'most_viewed'
    })
  }

  async postMovies(movie) {
    return this.post(
      `movies`, // path
      movie,
    )
  }

  async newMove(movie) {
    return this.put(
      `movies`,
      movie
    )
  }

  async updateMovie(movie) {
    return this.patch(
      `movies`,
      {id: movie.id, movie}
    )
  }

  async deleteMovie(movie) {
    return this.delete(
      `movies`/${movie.id}
    )
  }

  private progressLoader = new DatLoader(async (ids) => {
    const progressList = await this.get('progress', {
      ids: ids.join(',')
    })
    return ids.map(id => 
      progressList.find((progress) => progress.id === id)
    )
  })

  async getProgressFor(id) {
    return this.progress.Load(id)
  }
}


# caching
default, resource caching will use an in-memory LRU cache. When running multiple server instances, 
you'll want to use a shared cache backend instead. That's why Apollo Server also includes support 
for using Memcached or Redis as cache stores via the

const { RedisCache } = require('apollo-server-cache-redis)

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  cache: new RedisClient({
    host: 'redis-server'
  }),
})


#Error Handling
1) AuthenticationError
2) ForbidenError
3) UserInputError
4) Genereic ApolloErro


System Error

const {
  ApolloServer,
  gql
} = require('apollo-server')

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    readError: String,
    authenticationError: String
  },
  type Mutation {
    userInputError(input: String): String
  }
`
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    readError: (parent, args, context) => {
      fs.readFileSync('/does/not/exists')
    } 
    authenticationError: (parent, args, context) => {
      trow new AuthenticationError('must authenticate')
    }
  },
  Mutation: {
    userInputError: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      if(args.input !== 'expected' ) {
        throw new UserInputError('Form Argument invalid', {
          invalidArgs: Object.keys(args)
        })
      }
    }
    x: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      // Customize error
      throw ApolloError(message, code, additionalProps)
    }
  }
}

// format Error
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  formatError: (err) => {
    if(err.startsWith('Database Error')) {
      return new Error('Internal Server Error')
    }
    if(err.originalError instanceOf AuthenticationError) {
      return new Error('Different Authentication Error!')
    }
    return err
  }
})


#Subscription
Subscriptions are GraphQL operations that watch events emitted from Apollo Server
resolver map, we add a Subscription resolver that returns an AsyncIterator, which listens to the events asynchronously.

const { PubSub } = require('apollo-server')
const pubsub = new PubSub() 

- publish
- asyncIterator

const typeDefs =  gql`
  type Subscription {
    postAdded: Post
  }
  type Mutation {
    addPost(author: String, comment: String): Post
  }

`
const resolvers = {
  Subscription: {
    postAdded: {
      subscribe: () => pubsub.asyncIterator([POST_ADDED])
    }
  },
  Mutation: {
    addPost(parent, args, context, info) => {
      pubsub.publish(POST_ADDED, { postAdded: ards })
    }
  }
}


#Performance
#Caching
single GraphQL request consists of running many different resolvers, 
each of which can have different caching semantics. 
Some fields may be uncacheable. 
Some fields may be cacheable for a few seconds, and others for a few hours. 
Some fields may have values that are the same for all users of your app, 
and other fields may vary based on the current session.

user @cacheControl directive

type Post @cacheControl(maxAge: 240) {
  id: Int!
  votes: Int @cacheControl(maxAge: 30)
}

- resolver
If you don't know if the field is cacheable until u resolve it 

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    post: (parent, { id }, _, info) => {
      info.cacheControl.setCacheHint({ maxAge: 60, scope: 'PRIVATE' })
    }
  }
}

#Automatic persisted queries
Improve network performance by sending smaller requests

curl -g 'http://localhost:4000/?query={__typename}&extensions={"persistedQuery":{"version":1,"sha256Hash":"ecf4edb46db40b5132295c0291d62fb65d6759a9eedfa4d5d612dd5ec54a6b38"}}'

When the client makes a query, it will optimistically send a short (64-byte) cryptographic hash instead of the full query text.

Optimized Path: If a request containing a persisted query hash is detected, Apollo Server will look it up to find a corresponding query in its registry. 
Upon finding a match, Apollo Server will expand the request with the full text of the query and execute it.

New Query Path: In the unlikely event that the query is not already in the Apollo Server registry (this only happens the very first time that Apollo 
Server sees a query), it will ask the client to resend the request using the full text of the query. At that point, Apollo Server will store the 
query / hash mapping in the registry for all subsequent requests to benefit from.



#Security
#Authentication

Before figuring out the permission, we need to recognize the user

The context object is one that gets passed to every single resolver at every level, so we can access it anywhere in our schema code

Since the context is generated again with every new request, we don’t have to worry about cleaning up user data at the end of execution.


HTTP Header, JWT

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: ({req, res}) => {
    const token = req.headers.authorization || ''
    const user getUser(token)

  #Schema Authorization
    if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('you must be logged in')

    return { user }
  }
})


#Authorization
If we want to have more granular authorization on field level


user: (parent, args, context) => {
  if(!context.user) return null

  if(!context.user.roles.includes('admin;)) return null

  return ['Behrooz', 'Hesam']
}

#Data Model

context: ({req}) => {
  const token = req.headers.authentication || ''

  const user = getUser(token)

  if(!user) throw new AuthenticationError('you must be logged in to query')
  
  return {
    user,
    models : {
      user: generateUserModel({ user })
    }
  }
}

export const generateUserModel = ({user}) => {
  getAll: () => {
    if(!user || user.roles.includes('admin')) return null
    return fetch('url')
  },
  getUserById: (id) => {

  }
}
